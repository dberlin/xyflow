## Key Features

- **Easy to use:** Seamless zooming and panning, single- and multi selection of graph elements and keyboard shortcuts are supported out of the box
- **Customizable:** Different [node](https://solidflow.dev/examples) and [edge types](https://solidflow.dev/examples/edges/edge-types) and support for custom nodes with multiple handles and custom edges
- **Fast rendering:** Only nodes that have changed are re-rendered
- **Hooks and Utils:** [Hooks](https://solidflow.dev/api-reference/hooks) for handling nodes, edges and the viewport and graph [helper functions](https://solidflow.dev/api-reference/utils)
- **Plugin Components:** [Background](https://solidflow.dev/api-reference/components/background), [MiniMap](https://solidflow.dev/api-reference/components/minimap) and [Controls](https://solidflow.dev/api-reference/components/controls)
- **Reliable**: Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and tested with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Installation

The easiest way to get the latest version of Solid Flow is to install it via npm, yarn or pnpm:

```bash
npm install @xyflow/solid
```

## Quickstart

This is only a very basic usage example of Solid Flow. To see everything that is possible with the library, please refer to the [website](https://solidflow.dev) for [guides](https://solidflow.dev/learn/customization/custom-nodes), [examples](https://solidflow.dev/examples/overview) and the full [API reference](https://solidflow.dev/api-reference/solid-flow).

```jsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { SolidFlow, MiniMap, Controls, Background, useNodesState, useEdgesState, addEdge } from '@xyflow/solid';

import '@xyflow/solid/dist/style.css';

const initialNodes = [
  { id: '1', position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: { label: '1' } },
  { id: '2', position: { x: 0, y: 100 }, data: { label: '2' } },
];

const initialEdges = [{ id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }];

function Flow() {
  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

  const onConnect = useCallback((params) => setEdges((eds) => addEdge(params, eds)), [setEdges]);

  return (
    <SolidFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
      onConnect={onConnect}
    >
      <MiniMap />
      <Controls />
      <Background />
    </SolidFlow>
  );
}

export default Flow;
```

## Development

Before you can start developing please make sure that you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed (`npm i -g pnpm`). Then install the dependencies using pnpm: `pnpm install`.

Run `pnpm build` once and then you can use `pnpm dev` for local development.

## Testing

Testing is done with cypress. You can find the tests in the [`examples/vite-app/cypress`](/examples/vite-app/cypress/) folder. In order to run the tests do:

```sh
pnpm test
```

## Credits

Solid Flow was initially developed for [datablocks](https://datablocks.pro), a graph-based editor for transforming, analyzing and visualizing data in the browser. Under the hood, Solid Flow depends on these great libraries:

- [d3-zoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom) - used for zoom, pan and drag interactions with the graph canvas
- [d3-drag](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag) - used for making the nodes draggable
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - internal state management
